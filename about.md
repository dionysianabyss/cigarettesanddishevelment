Cigarettes & Dishevelment is a small literary project and living archive.

- Essays: long-form attempts at an honest psychology of being.
- Posts: shorter fragments, process notes, and meta commentary.
- Books: reading journals, quotations, and marginalia.
- Concepts: working definitions and genealogies of core ideas.

This project is, in spirit, a dossier of lucidity and devotion—my own mausoleum of clarity, tenderness under pressure, and revolt against easy consolations.

"The Absurd Man" is the figure behind the work: a commitment to lucidity without illusions, to difficult honesty, and to care that does not flee.
