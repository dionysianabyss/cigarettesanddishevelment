Ash is a record of heat the way a margin is a record of attention. What remains is not the fire, but its outline â€” a negative held together by patience and air.

I write to understand the shapes of what I would otherwise forget. The page forgives the draft that the mind refuses to hold; it is a way of honoring the imperfect persistence of thought.
