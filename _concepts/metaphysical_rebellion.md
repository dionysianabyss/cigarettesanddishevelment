interpretations:
  - philosopher: Albert Camus
    interpretation_text: |
      In The Rebel, metaphysical revolt is the movement by which a mind rejects a world it judges unacceptable while refusing suicide; it is a lucid "no" that preserves a deeper "yes" to human dignity.
  - philosopher: Jean-Paul Sartre
    interpretation_text: |
      Rebellion appears as praxis against bad faith: an assertion of freedom that refuses the temptation to ground itself in absolutes.
  - philosopher: Simone de Beauvoir
    interpretation_text: |
      Revolt is an ethics of ambiguity—solidarity with others in the face of contingency, without recourse to transcendent justification.
  - philosopher: Hannah Arendt
    interpretation_text: |
      To rebel is to break with inevitability; action interrupts the given and discloses plurality—though rebellion risks becoming ideology when it forgets beginnings.
  - philosopher: Albert Camus (1951)
    interpretation_text: |
      Rebellion must resist becoming murder; once the rebel makes history into a god, revolt decays into nihilism.

The rebel says yes and no: yes to human dignity, no to the unjust order that denies it.
