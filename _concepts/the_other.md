concept: The Other
discipline: philosophy
author: —
definition: |
  The presence of another consciousness that confronts, conditions, and reveals the self; the face, the gaze, the partner in and against whom identity is formed.
interpretations:
  - philosopher: Jean‑Paul Sartre
    interpretation_text: |
      In Being and Nothingness, the Other's gaze objectifies me; shame discloses myself‑as‑seen, revealing my facticity and freedom in conflict.
  - philosopher: Simone de Beauvoir
    interpretation_text: |
      In The Second Sex, "woman" is constituted as the Other through historical projects; liberation requires reciprocity rather than assimilation.
  - philosopher: Emmanuel Levinas
    interpretation_text: |
      The face of the Other commands me before all ontology; ethics is first philosophy—responsibility prior to knowledge.
  - philosopher: Martin Buber
    interpretation_text: |
      I–Thou relation affirms mutual presence beyond utility; the Other is encountered, not used.
  - philosopher: Jacques Lacan
    interpretation_text: |
      The big Other structures desire and language; subjectivity is knotted in the symbolic order that precedes the self.

We become by encountering what is not us; every gaze returns a question.
