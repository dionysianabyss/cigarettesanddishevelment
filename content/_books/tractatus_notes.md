# **Notes on Hermann Burger's _Tractatus Logico-Suicidalis_: Mortological Meditations**

## **Preliminaries: On Method and Madness**

What we have here is not a suicide note but a suicide _theory_ - and therein lies both its horror and its peculiar seduction. Burger, writing in 1988, knowing full well he'd be dead within eighteen months (barbiturates and alcohol, February 28, 1989), constructs not an apologia but a _wissenschaft_ - a science of self-murder that he dubs "mortology". The audacity is breathtaking: to systematize the unsystematizable, to render in 1,046 numbered propositions what Wittgenstein would call the limits of language itself.​

The translator Adrian Nathan West notes that Burger suffered from manic depression, that his wife and children left him, that he blamed his mother's prudery for his "genital migraines," that he compared his childhood bullying to Auschwitz and insisted he had it _worse_. This is the recursiveness of depression as memory disorder - autobiographical distortions that become constitutive of the self, whittle away "the very foundations of any possibility of feeling or even conceiving of joy". Depression as terminal illness (§63), not metaphor but literal fact: "you shrivel like a parched plant no one's bothered to tend to, hence the characteristic symptom of dry mouth".

## **I. Mortology vs. Thanatology: The Tautological Foundation**

**§1: "There is no natural death."**

Etymology saves us here. _Natura_ = birth, origin, essence. Death has nothing to do with birth. It is, as Burger insists with etymological precision, a _deus ex machina_ in the theater of nature (§7), a diabolus in musica (§7). When Schiller dies at 46, when Kafka is "liquidated" at 41, there's nothing natural about it. Mortology rejects the consoling lie of the natural, exposes death as radical intrusion, alien force, guillotine (§13).

The distinction between thanatology (Greek _Thanatos_ - "what second-rate etymology!") and mortology (German _Totologie_: _tot_ = dead + Latin _totus_ = whole, entire, total) is crucial. Thanatology is "the pseudoscience of death," drudgework, concerned with biological trivia. Mortology is "the doctrine and philosophy of the total predominance of death over life" (§4) - a subdiscipline of _tautologics_ (§26). The mortological equation: **"nothing equals nothing, black equals black"** (§26). Pure terminal logic. You'd recognize the mortologist "by the mark of Cain on his forehead" (§35).

**§31: Only two useful philosophical concepts exist: ontology and mortology.**​

Ontology = theory of being. Mortology = complementary _and superordinate_. The lexeme presides over its inflections; mortology subsumes all ontological chicanery. A representative of this universal science meeting an ontologist could only growl: "Learn mortology and die" (§32). Death would strike him where he stood.

This is Wittgenstein inverted. The _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_ opens: "The world is all that is the case". Burger's §76 counters: **"Death is all that is death."** As the crowning discipline, mortology alone may link the vitalogical rings "so that the preeminence of death over life appears seamless to the spectator". Magic trick. Mystery of the silver rings. You can hold them in your hands.​

## **II. The Death Drive: Freud, Améry, and the Inclination Toward Darkness**

**§37-38: Freud's _Beyond the Pleasure Principle_ - the death drive (_Todestrieb_).**

"The self-murderer stands permanently beyond the pleasure principle" (§38). Not temporarily, not as aberration, but as ontological stance. There exists a death-sexuality, death-libido, longing for unity with death (§39). See Edvard Munch. According to Freud, ego drives emerge through animation of inanimate matter and tend toward restoration of inanimateness (§40). The end point of all life is death; **"life is death in a fool's garb"** (§41); lifelessness precedes living. The death drive strives for restoration of the primordial.​

**§42: "Life is a roundabout way of reaching death."**

The drive to life, even self-preservation, in essence precipitates death. Hence the paradox Freud notes: the living organism resists with all its energy the very influences that could help it reach its life-goal by a short circuit. This is the behavior that characterizes pure instinct versus intelligent striving.​

**§44: Ammon's "destructive, self-oriented aggression" vs. Améry's "inclination toward death."**

Améry's term is better: **inclination describes a downward tendency**. All signs pointing to earth obey the gravitational pull of the cemetery. But this inclination is also aversion to life, to being. "The inclination toward death is not so much formed as it is suffered, even when the suffering is a flight from the pain of life. **It is concave, not convex**" (§44). Not active reaching-toward but passive sinking-into.​

**§46: "The self-murderer literally lets himself go."**

He does not stand in the way of a tendency toward what is, in the last instance, his place. This is crucial for understanding the phenomenology. Not violent self-assertion but _letting-go_. The leap (§134) as release, not attack. Later: "What we mean by leap: the suicidarian lets go of life the way the dying man lets go of his hopes for reanimation" (§134).​

## **III. The Logic of Death: Tautology, Kafka, and the Black Room**

**§20: "To kill yourself is to be exposed to the light of the law, which reveals itself as pure darkness."**

Kafka's "Before the Law" parable (§19): the man from the country sits his whole life before a door with ray of light through the crack, but the porter refuses entry. At the end: "This entrance was intended for you alone. I am leaving now, and I will close it". The laws of death. You sit before the door your entire life, then it closes forever.​

**§29: The mortological equation - "The absurdity of being = the absurdity of nothingness."**

Jean Améry's formulation from _On Suicide_: "Since I am still only living in order to die, only building the house so that it will collapse at the roofing ceremony, it is better to flee from death into death, or—thinking further, and more precisely—from the absurdity of existence into the absurdity of nothing" (§28). This is the mortological equation. No transcendence. No redemption. Just the tautology: absurdity → absurdity.

**§30: "What complicates the leap or letting go: man remains indebted to the logic of life down to his last breath."**​

This is the problem. We are trapped between two logics: the logic of life (which we cannot escape even in dying) and the logic of death (which we cannot penetrate, §159). The suicidarian is "torn between the logic of life and the logic of death" (Améry, §953). "In that consists the ontically murky singularity of their situation". The suicide stands with one foot in each world, and "where the two systems cross lies the Bermuda Triangle of existence" (§236).

**§159: "Death is always inexplicable, because we cannot penetrate its logic."**​

Survivors refuse to acknowledge this. They insist on comprehension, on motive, on _why_ or _in-order-to_ (§§147-149). But the self-murderer "stands outside all casuistics" (§150). The mortological response: **§181 - "he killed himself because he killed himself."** Pure tautology. Neither causal nor intentional explanation. The logic of death permits neither the _why_-motive nor the _in-order-to_ (§180).

**§142-143: The Black Room - Ringel's "narrowing of the world."**​

This is one of the most vivid phenomenological descriptions. The black room as "a funnel where you can neither stand up nor lie down, but must crouch like a person attending to his needs". The trap door is the _exitus_, which empties into the pit grave of the universe (§142). "The claustrophobia is unbearable as the funnel's black walls close in and you are ground to dust" (§143).

**§144: "Strange, the self-murderer's sense of space: even without jumping from the balcony of a high-rise, they have the feeling they are falling."**​

The vertigo of ontological collapse. Compare to Heidegger's _Angst_ - but this is not anxiety about possibilities, this is the certainty of the fall itself.
 
## **IV. Endogenous Depression: The Terminal Illness**
 
**§63: "Contrary to general prejudices, depression is a terminal illness, one ending in psychosomatic death."**
 
"You shrivel like a parched plant no one's bothered to tend to, hence the characteristic symptom of dry mouth". Not metaphor. Literal. Depression as mortal affliction. This is why Burger rejects Kübler-Ross's inclusion of "depression" as stage four of dying (§§61-62). Depression _already is_ the terminal state; to burden the death-candidate with additional depression would be "an existential pleonasm, one of the innumerable derelictions of creation" (§62).​
 
**§108: Erwin Ringel's "presuicidal syndrome" - narrowing of world, aggression against oneself, death fantasy.**
 
"At the top of his suicide tables stand the endogenous and the geriatric depressive; in comparison, crises and organic dementia are so insignificant as to barely merit mention" (§108). The endogenous depressive is the true mortological candidate.​
 
**§109: "For every day he doesn't take his own life, we should publicly sing the praises of the endogenous depressive. Instead, we wait patiently for him to pull the trigger, then console those he leaves behind."**
 
Stunning reversal. The daily heroism unrecognized. The alarm function (§131) arrives too late. "Many suicides might be averted if this alarm were sounded while one was still alive" (§171).​
 
**§377: The most dangerous moment - "The endogenous depressive kills himself not because he's in a bottomless pit—au contraire, he'd be all too pleased to disappear into one; instead, he ends it all when he seems to be getting better. Only then does he recognize the full extent of his tragic fate."**
 
This is what killed Burger. Discharged from hospital January 1989, in fever state planning radio/TV appearances, meeting with publisher about _Brenner_ tetralogy to rival Proust. The manic exuberance following the depressive trough. February 11, 1989: "Death is near, nearer than ever". Seventeen days later: dead.
 
**§112: "The suicide's health, which endows him with the sovereign force required to declare war on life, is naturally restricted to a few brief moments analogous to those lucid intervals that brighten a depression."**
 
**§513: Cioran - "A man does not kill himself in a fit of madness but rather in a fit of unendurable lucidity - in a paroxysm."**​
 
Frenzied aggravation of already existing complaints. The irrevo cable quaking of the volcano. Not insanity but hyper-sanity. Not clouded judgment but terminal clarity.
 
**§514: "This observation tallies with the experience of endogenous depressives. What is dangerous is not the depths, but emerging from them, the lucid intervals."**
 
The bobsled metaphor: risk of crashing is greatest just after you turn the corner. "The depressed person is like the bobsled pilot under 4G pressure, but instead of holding him snug to the wall, it grinds him into the earth" (§515). The critical point comes when the centrifugal force gives out, and he's reached the high point from which he can get a clear impression of his sufferings' extent (§515).
 
## **V. Typology of Self-Murder: Terminological Precision**
 
**§89: Four categories - suicidarian, suicidal, suicide, suicidalist.**​
 
-   **Suicidarian**: plans his own death, but is content with the thought of it
    
-   **Suicidal**: tries to kill himself and fails​
    
-   **Suicide**: succeeds in killing himself
    
-   **Suicidalist** (or mortological suicide): furnishes a scientific basis for his act​
    
 
**§90: "The suicidarian may easily become a suicide proper, for the savage god of suicide is a stubborn taskmaster."**
 
**§91: "Never will a suicidalist become a mere suicide, or a suicide a suicidal, or a suicidal a suicidarian."**​
 
One-way progression. Hierarchy. The suicidalist occupies highest rung - this is Burger's category, the category of this very _Tractatus_. He is not merely ending his life; he is constructing the theoretical architecture that renders his death philosophically necessary.
 
**§166-167: The holy trinity of suicide - dying, killing, and being killed.**
 
"The proprietary nature of the suicide's death style—_sua manu cadere_, to fall by one's own hand—derives from the three forms of annihilation it implies: dying, killing, and being killed. Mortology demands a novel reflexive form, the rendering transitive of an intransitive verb: **I die myself**" (§166). Not "I kill myself" (which is grammatical) but "I die myself" (which violates language to capture the unique ontological position). §167 repeats for emphasis: "This is the holy trinity of suicide: dying, killing, and being killed".
 
## **VI. Survivors and the Alibi Factory**
 
**§68: "By living, the survivor betrays the dead."**​
 
If Kübler-Ross had outlined stages for the survivor, this one would be known as _betrayal_ (§68). "The death of an acquaintance or relative is like euthanasia-in-life for those who remain behind. They mistake a particular instance of death as evidence that they've managed to escape it" (§68). Hence the "nigh-bacchanalian revelry of funeral banquets" (§68).
 
**§72: "To condole, to share one's sympathies, comes from the Latin root word _dolere_, to feel pain, to suffer. But if this pain were really so unbearable, it would surely drive us to suicide."**​
 
In truth, "we don't condole, we congratulate the next of kin on his survival, and in doing so, we are actually talking to ourselves. **The so-called condolence is our elixir of life**" (§72).
 
**§73: "If we really cared about condoling, we would condole the suicide while he was still living."**​
 
**§145: "Survivors appropriate the motives of the suicide, who can no longer defend himself, and repurpose them as an alibi for themselves."**
 
The least sign that they were absent from the crime scene raises them above suspicion. This is the criminological perspective (§139): perpetrator, offense, corpse, weapon, motive - but no alibi. "Not even the most artistic suicide will be able to state for the record postmortem that when he allegedly fired a bullet into his own head, he was in fact at the cinema" (§139).​
 
**§146: "The survivors exonerate themselves with the words: he killed himself because... or he killed himself in order to..."**
 
**§§147-149: The distinction between _why_ (causal) and _what for_ (intentional/final).**​
 
The causal perspective seeks the basis for events; the intentional reveals the purpose. "Logically, _in order to_ takes precedence over _why_. Finality is prospective, causality retrospective" (§157). But both are evasions. "The self-murderer stands outside all casuistics" (§150).
 
**§152: "Either way, the motive produces understanding, and understanding is transformed into alibi."**​
 
**§153: "Suicide notes merely facilitate the conceit of the alibi. It is therefore best to liquidate yourself without a word, unless you are a suicidalist substantiating a theory."**
 
This _Tractatus_ is the exception that proves the rule. Not a suicide note (pissing and moaning, §154) but a suicide _theory_.
 
**§158: "In construing motive into alibi, survivors elude the shadow of suspicion the act casts upon them. No one is permitted to point out to them that they are necessarily implicated in a suicide that occurs in their immediate vicinity. Mortology, however, allows itself this luxury."**
 
The audacity of this. To tell survivors: you are complicit. You failed to sound the alarm (§171). You waited for the trigger-pull, then consoled each other (§109).

## **VII. Cioran: Suicide as Optimism, Meditation as Liberation**

Emil Cioran (1911-1995), Romanian pessimist, radical skeptic, aphorist par excellence. Burger draws heavily on his insights.

**§485: "To meditate on the act is almost as liberating as committing it" (Cioran).**

"He who reflects on suicide throughout his life is less endangered—less _gifted_, the mortologist would say—than the person driven by the sudden impulse to self-destruction" (§485). The quotidian suicidarian as philosopher. Contemplation as prophylaxis? Or preparation?​

**§496: Cioran's new catechism formula - "Grant us, Lord, the favor and the force to end it all, the grace to eliminate ourselves in time."**

**§505: "When a man has exhausted his _raison d'être_, it is odious to persist."**​

Cioran: "This, indeed, is the indignity of natural death which we discover wherever we happen to look" (§505).

**§513: "A man does not kill himself, as is commonly supposed, in a fit of madness but rather in a fit of unendurable lucidity - in a paroxysm" (Cioran).**​

Frenzied aggravation of already existing complaints. Irrevo cable quaking of the volcano. The lucid interval as danger zone (§§514-515).

**§544: Cioran calls the drive for self-preservation "obstinacy" and pleads for suicide to be made pleasant and accessible to all.**

Compare to §79: "We must found schools for suicide, exitus institutes!" Mortological pedagogy. Curriculum includes practicum in apparent death, unit on oblivion (§§541-542).

Cioran's famous dictum (not in this text but relevant): "Only optimists commit suicide, optimists who no longer succeed at being optimists". The others, having no reason to live, why would they have any to die? This resonates with Burger's §536: "The obsession with suicide is characteristic of the man who can neither live nor die, and whose attention never swerves from this double impossibility".[reddit+1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pessimism/comments/f1i4ei/anyone_heard_of_hermann_burger/)

## **VIII. Jean Améry: The Inclination Toward Death and the Échec Ultime**

Jean Améry (1912-1978), Austrian essayist, Auschwitz survivor, committed suicide by overdose in Salzburg hotel. His 1976 _On Suicide: A Discourse on Voluntary Death_ is Burger's primary interlocutor.

**§24: Améry's mortological insight - "My death is beyond logic and habitual thought, for me it is contrary to nature in the highest degree, it is offensive to reason and to life. One cannot bear to think about it."**​

Death's un- and anti-natural traits (§24). "Following Améry: the unnatural death is greater than God" (§25). "Everyone has seen a dead person, but God remains constantly in hiding, 'That's the trick He lives by'" (§25).

**§28: "Since I am still only living in order to die, only building the house so that it will collapse at the roofing ceremony, it is better to flee from death into death, or—thinking further, and more precisely—from the absurdity of existence into the absurdity of nothing."**​

This is Améry's formulation of the mortological equation (§29). No escape from absurdity. Only transposition from one register to another.

**§74: "Améry says the inclination to voluntary death is not an illness you cure a person of the way you cure him of measles. For this reason, we never say to those on the verge of suicide, _Get well soon_."**

**§133: L'échec ultime - the ultimate checkmate.**

From Améry's _On Suicide_. The suicidarian is trapeze artist par excellence, working without a net. "Whatever he has left before the _échec ultime_... his human ties or his relationship with his therapist, all of it snaps as soon as he takes the leap" (§133).​

**§176: "_L'échec ultime_ is the last straw."**

**§177: "Life itself steers toward the _échec ultime_ of death. Is it not better, then, to die by one's own hand than by the hand of cancer or the hand of heart failure?"**​

**§526: "My death is beyond logic and habitual thought... contrary to nature in the highest degree, offensive to reason and to life" (Améry).**

This is the unnatural violence, antinatural traits of death (§526). Burger channels Améry: "Were it somehow natural for Georg Büchner to be snatched away by typhus at 23 years of age?" (§8).

**§953: Améry on the suicide torn between two logics - "in that consists the ontically murky singularity of their situation."**

"He is aware of this death-logic or death-antilogic even when there is no room for it in our system of expressive possibilities" (§953).

## **IX. Wittgenstein and Kafka: Language, Logic, Law**

**§16: Wittgenstein's _Tractatus_ opening - "The world is all that is the case."**

Burger's response: "but the case refers exclusively to past, present, and future. We do not experience our own death" (§16).​

**§76: Mortological inversion - "Death is all that is death."**

"As the crowning discipline of the science of the spirit, nature, and death, it alone may link the vitalogical rings... so that the preeminence of death over life appears seamless to the spectator, who is even allowed to hold the rings in his hands" (§76). The magic trick. Mystery of the silver rings.​

**§200: Wittgenstein right that "death is not an event of life, because we cannot experience death."**

"But he errs in averring that he who lives in the present is eternal, if we take eternity to mean not endless duration but timelessness" (§200). Atemporality and antitemporality are mortological concepts (§201). "There is no proportionality in relation to death, and thus no eternal remaining in the present" (§201).​

**§1025: Wittgenstein's _Notebooks_ 1917 - "suicide is the hinge on which ethics turns."**

"If suicide is allowed, then everything is allowed... And when one investigates it, it is like investigating mercury vapor in order to comprehend the nature of vapors. Or is even suicide in itself neither good nor evil?" (§1025).​

**§19: Kafka's "Before the Law" parable.**

"The laws of death: you sit your whole life long, like the man from the country in Kafka's parable, before a door with a ray of light shining through the crack, but the porter refuses to let you in, and in the end, you suffer the indignity of hearing: 'This entrance was intended for you alone. I am leaving now, and I will close it'" (§19).​

**§20: "To kill yourself is to be exposed to the light of the law, which reveals itself as pure darkness."**

**§215: "Doorbell to Hell's porter: sometimes it works, usually it doesn't."**​

"Compare the doorbell to the graves of the apparent dead, Gaussian beams, and so on. The false door: it seems you could slit it open softly with a knife's edge, but behind it: the firewall of night, the firewall of night" (§215). Repetition for emphasis. The wall is absolute.

## **X. Thomas Bernhard: Comedy, Tragedy, and the Comic Actor's Leap**

Thomas Bernhard (1931-1989), Austrian novelist, died same year as Burger (natural causes). Burger calls him "_poeta doctus suicidalis_" (§121).

**§121: Bernhard's story "In Earnest" from _The Voice Imitator_.**​

"A comic actor... who had lived for decades by being funny, suddenly became—this _suddenly_ is of supreme importance for mortology—the long-awaited situation for a group of Bavarian excursionists who came across him on the rocky ledge above the so-called Salzburg horse-pond. The actor stated that just as he was, in his lederhosen and with his Tyrolean hat on his head, he would throw himself off the ledge, at which the group of excursionists had as usual burst into loud laughter. **But the actor is reported to have said that he was in earnest and to have immediately thrown himself off the ledge**" (§121).

**§122: "Did Bernhard's comic actor shatter the world's frame, or did he fall from it? Is this a tragedy or is it a comedy?"**​

Reference to Emil Staiger's _Basic Concepts of Poetics_ (§82): "If we described the tragic as that which shatters the frame of the world, then of the comic, we would say it falls out of the world's frame and remains there in an obvious and conspicuous way".

**§123: "The mortologist replies: He wasn't too good to serve as a punchline."**​

**§124: "Unfortunately, the story is unfinished, the author neglected to add that the Bavarian excursionists went on laughing after the comic actor plunged to his death."**

**§125: "To speak of ourselves in this _Tractatus_... we imagine those close to us as a group of excursionists embarking on a journey through our existence, and add a codicil to our last will and testament: if we fall, they are to go on laughing."**​

Burger speaking directly, breaking the frame of the aphoristic form. Acknowledging his own position. His survivors will be the Bavarian excursionists. Let them laugh.

**§127: "Let's admit it: our dearth was our kin's mirth."**

Wordplay. _Dearth_ = scarcity, poverty, but sounds like _death_. Our lack was their laughter. Our death their entertainment.

**§128: "This is the comedy and tragedy of suicide: even as a corpse, no one will take you seriously."**​

**§249: "That Bernhard's readers, so far as is known, were not infected by the Austrian's suicide-orgies reveals this classic author's consummate impotence."**

Burger criticizing Bernhard: "He describes himself as an exaggeration artist. But one ought not exaggerate about suicide, for in doing so, one robs the candidate of his impulse to make his death wishes reality" (§250). "This speaks in favor of the suicidal equipoise of Goethe's _Werther_" (§251), which actually _did_ inspire a wave of suicides (§§244-245).

## **XI. Prestidigitation, Magic, and the Art of Disappearance**

**§36: "While the thanatologist or thanatosopher tries to fob you off with pure nonsense, the mortologist grasps you in the iron spider of his specific terminal logic. A master of white and black magic, he makes the coin you've lent him vanish, and you're left staring at the empty table as though into a black hole."**

"In a turn of phrase common among insurance salespeople, he tells you: **in the event, you, like the pilfered coin, will no longer be there tomorrow**" (§36). As his performance proceeds, the drive to no longer be there becomes overwhelming.​

**§138: "Our chosen death won't leave us in the lurch. Even on the locked ward of a psychiatric clinic, you can trick the nurses and hoard your medicines, swallowing dummies when they watch you take your pills. See also: suicide and magic."**

**§242: "The suicide... gives himself a gift ordinary mortals will never manage to enjoy."**​

"Drawing on" the deaths of relatives and acquaintances, "maintaining the fiction that he too is mortal right to the very end" (§241), the suicide creates "a private death," "a borrowed death" (§242). But then transcends it: "the suicide evades this thanatological absurdity by furnishing himself with a death of his own. He gives himself a gift ordinary fellow mortals will never manage to enjoy" (§242).

**§503: "Vanish—that is the right word. Whoever ends his own life performs an act of prestidigitation—he is a magician in the highest sense of the word. What once was life—kalamazam!—has now vanished into nothing."**​

This after Shakespeare's "bare bodkin" (§502). Simple decency demands you set the hour of your disappearance yourself (§501).

Connection to Burger's other work: the story "Diabelli: Prestidigitator" (mentioned in the framing narrative) about "a disillusioned illusionist determined to make himself disappear and to end an acclaimed but futile career". The magician who simulates suicide onstage but also commits it through an illusion (framing narrative). As the curtain falls, existence is rent asunder.

## **XII. Revolutionary Act, Terrorism, Absolute Freedom**

**§59: "Death is the exhaustive revolutionizing of life."**

**§97: "Our era clamors for one and another's emancipation, making it hard to understand why the suicide remains society's last great outsider."**

**§98: "Society excommunicates the suicide, none wants to enter his closed world."**​

**§99: "If his plan succeeds, they will mark the suicide as a criminal; if it fails, as a madman."**

**§243: "In view of the nuclear and ecological disasters, the looming omnicide, that the world faces, the suicide's solution is an artistic and revolutionary act: he anticipates—_pars pro toto_ and for mortology's sake—a fate the entire world must sooner or later undergo."**​

"This resolute step puts him leagues ahead of the chronically healthy clinging hungrily to life" (§243).

**§523: "Suicide is the one and only absolute act a person may commit without ifs, ands, or buts."**​

"And this is why those left behind should not gloss it over with quibbles about ifs, ands, or buts" (§523).

**§524: "Before the absoluteness of suicide, every lived pursuit is irrelevant."**
