There is a peculiar difficulty that confronts anyone who reads seriously, thinks seriously, and still dares to love. The ordinary world writes marriage vows as if they were small prayers to an unexamined metaphysics—promises of permanence, assurances of unshakable unity, optimistic gestures at a harmony untouched by time or entropy. They are written from the neck up, but sealed in a register of sentimentality that dissolves under even moderate philosophical scrutiny. Their comfort comes from the illusion that life will obey the grammar of hope.

The philosophically inclined do not enjoy such shelter. We know too much; or rather, we refuse to pretend we know what cannot be known. We cannot write vows as if the human is not profoundly fragile, inconsistent, aging, fearful, desirous, and half-opaque even to itself. We cannot promise the eternal. We cannot promise what cannot exist. And yet, surprisingly, we do not become cynical. If anything, our lucidity forces us to write vows far more serious than the conventional ones, because they emerge from an honest appraisal of what marriage actually is: a chosen discipline, not a metaphysical guarantee.

The paradox is simple: philosophy deprives you of illusions, but it gives you back the dignity of choosing without them. In that space—bleak, clear, and strangely tender—we write our vows.

## I. The Failure of Traditional Vows

Most vows are structured like miniature myths: *I will always love you, I will never falter, we are one soul, time cannot touch us, nothing will change.* They mistake devotion for destiny. They promise what only death can promise: an end to change. But living things do not obey such commandments. They shift, withdraw, return, contradict themselves, get overwhelmed. Even the most devoted partner will someday fail. That is not tragedy; that is human.

The philosophically inclined cannot ignore this. Camus warned against “philosophical suicide”—the habit of lying to oneself for the sake of safety. Traditional vows flirt with that temptation. They smuggle in eternity disguised as sentiment. They offer a vision of love that is static, frictionless, blessed by the gods of Hallmark and Hollywood.

But a vow that denies the human condition is not a vow. It is a fantasy auditioning for permanence.

Philosophically honest vows begin elsewhere.

## II. A Vow Is Not a Prediction

The first principle is this: **a vow is not a prediction; it is a commitment enacted in time.**

A prediction tries to see the future.
A vow accepts that it cannot.

When Beauvoir wrote that genuine love is “two freedoms mutually choosing,” she meant that love is not a contract between fixed entities, but a living pact between beings who are each capable of leaving, changing, despairing, or transcending themselves. To love under such conditions is not to foresee stability, but to remain faithful to the work of choosing.

Thus the philosophically inclined vow-maker does not say:
*I guarantee I will feel for you tomorrow what I feel today.*
They say instead:
*I will remain present enough to confront tomorrow when it arrives.*

This is not cold.
It is the only warmth that does not lie.

## III. Love Under the Absurd

Marriage vows written from philosophical ground must contend with the absurd: that our longing for meaning collides with a world that offers none. Kierkegaard would call this the “dizziness of freedom.” Camus would call it lucid revolt. Cioran would simply shrug and remind us that even devotion rots eventually.

But this is not a reason to avoid vows. It is a reason to craft them with care.

The absurd does not abolish love; it only eliminates its illusions. If anything, it sharpens it. Nothing heightens devotion like the awareness that nothing guarantees it. When you cannot rely on destiny, you must rely on attention; when you cannot rely on metaphysics, you must rely on character.

Thus the philosophically inclined vow is not written to escape the absurd. It is written *in defiance of it*.

A vow, in this view, is a small rebellion:
*Against entropy, I choose to maintain you.*
*Against the indifference of the universe, I choose to care.*
*Against the collapse of meaning, I create some with you.*

Not eternal meaning; just enough meaning to justify tomorrow.

## IV. The Discipline of Devotion

One of the philosopher’s temptations is abstraction. But marriage is not lived in abstractions; it is lived in moods, chores, fears, mornings, illnesses, small humiliations, small mercies. Marriage is morning breath and tax forms. It is the accumulation of mundane gestures that no metaphysics has ever bothered to catalogue.

The vows of the philosophically inclined must therefore bridge the abstract and the concrete. They must speak the language of both ontology and washing dishes.

We might say:

*I cannot promise I will never err, but I can promise I will return from error quickly, without pride.*

*I cannot promise I will never wound you, but I can promise I will not hide from the consequences of doing so.*

*I cannot promise that life will treat us gently, but I can promise that I will not treat you with the cruelty of neglect.*

A philosopher knows that character is formed in habits, not declarations. Thus the vow must include the mundane: attention, patience, repair, listening, boundaries, gentleness where possible, firmness where necessary.

This is devotion as discipline—not as sentimentality.

## V. The Vow as Mutual Contingency

Sartre taught that the Other is both necessary and threatening: necessary because they reveal us to ourselves, threatening because they are free to leave, to judge, to change. Marriage intensifies this dynamic. To vow oneself to another is to accept the risk that your sense of self becomes partially anchored in a freedom you do not control.

Therefore, the philosophically inclined must incorporate contingency into their vows. Not the contingency of indifference, but the contingency of mutuality.

*Your existence intersects with mine, but does not absorb it.*
*I choose you without demanding that you become my mirror.*
*I will not devour your freedom to secure my own.*

Byung-Chul Han’s critique of the modern eros—flattened, frictionless, purified of otherness—reveals why this matters. Lovers today often treat each other as lifestyle accessories: sources of validation, reflection, and convenience. But the philosophically inclined reject that. They love someone precisely *because* they remain an Other, an opacity, a freedom, and therefore a risk.

A good vow acknowledges the risk and refuses to domesticate it.

## VI. Tenderness Without Delusion

One of the great misunderstandings about philosophical clarity is the assumption that it sterilizes emotion. The opposite is true. Clarity intensifies tenderness, because you know what is at stake. You know how improbable it is that two lives manage to intersect at all, let alone intertwine. You know how quickly joy can turn. You know how easily beauty disappears.

A vow written from philosophical ground is therefore neither cold nor sentimental. It is tender *because* it is sober.

Rilke said, “For one human being to love another: that is perhaps the most difficult of all our tasks.” A vow that takes that difficulty seriously is not harsh; it is intimate. It acknowledges that love is not a spontaneous eruption of feeling but a form of craftsmanship.

Thus tenderness appears in the vow not as melodrama, but as skill.

*I will cultivate the capacity to see you clearly when my moods distort you.*
*I will speak to you gently when it would be easier to withdraw.*
*I will not use your vulnerabilities as leverage.*
*I will protect the atmosphere in which our affection can breathe.*

This is tenderness that requires courage, not sentiment.

## VII. What Cannot Be Promised

A philosophical vow must also articulate what it refuses to promise. This is not pessimism; it is adult honesty.

One cannot promise:

* To never change.
* To never feel weary.
* To always desire.
* To never be afraid.
* To always understand.
* To never doubt.
* To always be strong.

One cannot promise:

* That love will remain identical to its earlier forms.
* That the world will not interfere.
* That tragedy will never touch us.

To pretend otherwise is to promise stability in a universe defined by flux.

But one *can* promise:

* To face these changes without fleeing into resentment.
* To speak openly when desire dims or shifts.
* To rebuild affection when its structure weakens.
* To resist the temptation to use fatigue as an excuse for indifference.
* To refuse passive cruelty.
* To remain reachable.

These are promises that require not eternity, but effort.

## VIII. The Marriage Vow as Philosophical Act

A vow is not simply a declaration of feeling. It is a **philosophical position**: a stance toward existence, finitude, and responsibility.

To vow marriage as a philosopher is to say:

*I acknowledge the absurd—yet I choose you.*
*I acknowledge impermanence—yet I will build what can be built.*
*I acknowledge your freedom—and I will not try to bind it with illusions.*
*I acknowledge my own capacities for foolishness—and I vow to mitigate them.*
*I acknowledge the world’s indifference—and I will not let that indifference stain how I treat you.*

Marriage becomes not the denial of absurdity, but its counter-expression. It becomes the construction of a small island of meaning in a sea that will never justify it. And because it cannot be justified by the cosmos, it must be justified by conduct.

This is the philosophical vow:
*Meaning created through behaviour.*

## IX. The Unspectacular Heroism of Consistency

If love is to survive the long durée of marriage, it does not need fireworks. It needs dailiness. It needs the unromantic heroism of showing up.

This is perhaps the philosopher’s hardest lesson. We are drawn to intensity, abstraction, grand gesture, ontological clarity. But marriage is sustained by something quieter.

The vow must therefore recognise the heroic in the mundane:

*I vow to practice affection even on the days when emotion is absent.*
*I vow to repair ruptures promptly, without dramatic staging.*
*I vow to carry my half of our shared life without treating it as martyrdom.*
*I vow to listen more frequently than I speak.*
*I vow to remember that you exist, not merely as a role in my story, but as an entire universe intersecting with mine.*

These are small vows, but they are the ones that matter. A marriage collapses more often from neglect than catastrophe.

## X. Writing the Vow Itself

How then does the philosophically inclined actually write the vow?

Not with ornamentation. Not with performative sentiment. Not with the inflated language of eternity.

The vow should have the clarity of a knife. It should be composed as if one were engraving on a stone that will weather centuries while the couple themselves will not. The question is not what sounds impressive but what one wishes to be held accountable to.

A suggested structure:

1. **A short recognition of absurdity and finitude.**
   “Life is uncertain, fragile, and often cruel. Nothing in it is guaranteed.”

2. **A declaration of willing choice.**
   “And still, I choose you—without myth, without illusion, without coercion.”

3. **A statement of responsibility.**
   “I will remain answerable for the effects of my actions, moods, silences, and words upon you.”

4. **A commitment to presence.**
   “I will stay reachable, even when retreat would be easier.”

5. **A commitment to repair.**
   “When I fracture what matters, I will not retreat into pride. I will repair.”

6. **A commitment to reciprocity without possession.**
   “I do not claim you as mine; I claim myself as devoted to you.”

7. **A closing vow of lucid devotion.**
   “I cannot promise eternity. I can only promise that while I am here, I will treat this love as something worth tending.”

This is more durable than any promise of “forever.” It is a vow that will not embarrass itself under scrutiny. It can withstand the shifting weather of decades. It is a vow one can keep.

## XI. A Final Note: The Small, Brave Yes

In the end, for all our philosophical literacy, for all our cynicism, clarity, exhaustion, intelligence, and existential sobriety, marriage vows come down to something profoundly simple.

They are an act of courage.

To write such vows is to admit that even after understanding the world’s indifference, even after dismantling illusions, even after studying the anatomy of desire, suffering, and the Other—you still choose to stand beside someone and affirm: *Yes.*

Not the naïve yes of fairy tales.
The adult yes.
The yes that knows how breakable we are.
The yes that trembles because it understands contingency.
The yes that knows a vow is not a shield but a task.

This is how the philosophically inclined write their marriage vows:
with lucid tenderness, with sober courage, with the stubborn dignity of those who know that nothing lasts—
and vow anyway.
